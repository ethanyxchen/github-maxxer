# Hammertime

A native macOS app for tracking the pull requests you merge, across personal projects and work repositories.

Set daily, weekly, and monthly targets for personal work and each organisation. Connect multiple GitHub accounts, choose entire repository owners or individual repositories, and see your progress against them.

## Install

Requires macOS 26 or newer.

```sh
brew install --cask ethanyxchen/tap/hammertime
```

Update to the latest release with `brew upgrade --cask hammertime`.

## Connect GitHub

Hammertime connects through [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com). Install it and sign in once:

```sh
brew install gh
gh auth login
```

Then choose **Connect GitHub** in Hammertime and click **Connect**. Hammertime links the account GitHub CLI is signed in to, with the same permissions. Its credential is saved in macOS Keychain. GitHub CLI's default sign in includes private repositories; organizations may require approval or SSO authorization before their private activity is accessible.

To add another account, run `gh auth login` for it, which also makes it GitHub CLI's active account, then connect again in Hammertime. Connecting the same account again updates its credential and activity while keeping its name and repository selections. Reconnect or disconnect from **Targets & Accounts**. Disconnecting removes Hammertime's copy of the credential; GitHub CLI stays signed in.
